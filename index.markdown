# Statement by Alma Hilton Marsells

## Our Familv Treasure
This is dedicated to the memory of my beloved husband, William Bernard Marsells, born April 22, 1927 and died February 19, 1991. Bill was such an important part of my life! I cannot imagine what my life would have been without him. Without him, our children and grandchildren would have been non-existent. Bill had a zest for life, but was the most caring person for anyone close to him.

About 1943, our paths first crossed. We were all working at Mars, Inc. (the candy company). There were many teenagers working there during World War II; but there was a small group that developed very close friendships - this consisted of approximately 6 girls and 9 boys -- there was no "pairing off”. Almost every weekend, our gang would plan fun events. Most of the time we went to the beach in the summer and Bill would bring his "medicine ball" (which, as I remember, was a full 3' in diameter when it was blown up - it was like a large beach ball with a tough cover). The girls would bring a picnic lunch, and the boys would bring the soda or Kool Aid, and the air pump. While the girls set up the food, the fellows would blow up the medicine ball; then we would play either Dodge Ball or Keep Away - we had so much fun! For a change, we would sometimes go to a forest preserve for a picnic and a game of softball, or spend the day at the swimming pool at Riis Park in Chicago. We would pick a meeting place, and take the streetcar or bus (sometimes both) to wherever we had decided to go for the day. When it was time to go home, we each went our own way. In the wintertime, it was ice-skating, tobogganing and snowball fights (that ended up with a lot of "face washing").

Bill's friends were so important to him. He was always with the boys. His boyfriends were all interested in girls long before Bill took an interest. Dating girls came about as a necessity so that he could be with his friends. In 1946 they took the stand that if he wanted to continue to go places with them, he had to find a girl as they were taking their girlfriends with them. I used to feel sorry for any girl that would date Bill as he would get on the streetcar or bus, and very seldom check to see that they got on. When Doris Drury asked him to take her to the Trinity High School prom, would you believe, he rented the tux, but loaded his chest down with Ben Gay. She didn't dance too much with Bill, as every time they tried dancing, the odor would really get to her. Through the years, Bill often laughed reminiscing about that night. In his mind, girls weren't for him to date - they were to provide him a chance to be with his friends.

Deen and Bill were in the same Army Air Force unit stationed at Chanute Field. (Deen Holland and Bill were lifelong friends - went into the Army at different times, and Deen was later transferred to the base where Bill was stationed and was under him.) On the 25th, on the train going to Chicago, Bill had asked Deen as to what could they do for the weekend? Deen replied that he was going to spend the time with his steady girlfriend, Mary (not the Mary he married), so that the only way Bill could be with them was if he had a date too. When Bill said he didn't know of any girl that he would want to ask on a date, Deen suggested that he call me. That sounded okay to Bill, as I was not a girl, in his mind, I was one of the "gang". When he called, it just so happened that my date had become sick so I had the night free. Remembering the good times we had had with our gang, we had our first date, May 26, 1946. Needless to say, we had such a good time, that every weekend thereafter we were together, and one month later, June 26th, we were going steady and wearing each other's high school graduation rings. November 23, 1949 we were married.

During the period we were dating, I woke up one morning with a "full-blown" case of German measles (my 4th case). Bill came by the house with my first bouquet of flowers: a dozen gladiolas with a card addressed to "My Polka Dot Queen". I faintly remember the card had a picture of a girl sitting in bed, and he had covered the face with red dots.

Bill was very close to his parents - but especially his mother. From 1945 through June 10th, 1948, when she died, she fought a desperate battle with cancer. She was only about 5' and weighed about 200 lbs. before the cancer was discovered. When she died she didn't even weigh 50 lbs. When Bill got out of the service, he gave his Dad his severance pay; along with all the money he had saved to put towards the mountain of bills his mother's illness had created. Times were very different at that time- individual hospitalization was not available as it is today, and Bill's Dad, even though he was earning a very good wage, was drowning in debt from the medical bills. Bill had not loaned the money to Dad, it was a gift that he did not expect to get back. (That is the kind of guy that Bill was.)

During the days of World War II, many boys dropped out of high school to enlist in the military service, to do their part in "fighting to defend our freedom" - Bill was one of those fellows. He had been going to school at Fenwick High School in Oak Park (a private Catholic college preparatory school) and had had all intentions of going on to college when he graduated from high school. Fenwick changed their policies, and arranged for these "drop outs", while they were in the service, to complete their high school credits through correspondence. Bill completed his requirements and received his high school diploma through the mail.

When Bill was discharged from the Air Corps, he enrolled at the University of Illinois, planning to get his college degree. But, that was one dream that he was not to realize. Bill's mother's health was really deteriorating, and when his Dad could not find anyone to care for Bill's Mom while Dad was at work, Bill dropped out of college and chose to stay home to care for his mother. It was 2 years that Bill devoted to his mother and was proud that he was able to do that for his parents. Bill was always squeamish at the sight of blood, yet God gave him the strength and will power to care for his mother in a manner that he himself never believed that he could. (For many years, after his mother's death, Bill would wake up from a deep sleep, in the middle of night, thinking he heard his mother calling to him for help - for the 1st year of our married life, it was every night.)

Bill's mother was the instigator for our being married. Bill and I had broken up 3 different times because of our religious background. As she was a very strict Polish, Roman Catholic, it surprised Bill, when she always tried to get us back together. It was her fervent desire that we would get married. Her biggest dream was that one day she would get well, and we would be married, and that she would be there to celebrate our wedding. She often told us that she wanted to see us married, and that she wanted us to have a granddaughter for her to play hopscotch or jump rope with. (That is why, when each one of our daughters was born, Bill always looked at me with tears in his eyes and say, "Mom, would have been so very happy!") It was that deep desire that she had, that caused Bill to play his biggest prank on me.

My mother had always been very strict with me. Bill and I were going steady, and mother was not very happy about it. To date Bill, I was really defying Mom. At the time she had not gotten to know Bill - all she knew was that he was Catholic, and that was a big no, no . Mother had a very strict code of ethics of how a girl should act, types of gifts that were acceptable (never anything very personal) and what types of people were dating or marriage material (1st and 2nd generation foreign-born were okay people to talk to or be friendly to, but a different "class" for a daughter to marry).
As Bill and I had finally reached the point where we had decided that we each wanted to spend the rest of our lives together, Bill told me he was going to get me a negligee gown and robe for Christmas; what color would I like? I was horrified, how could I face Mom? I'd probably be thrown out on the street. The more I worried about it, the more Bill talked about the gift. He decided it had to be a black one. For several weeks, that was all I heard. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get Bill to give up this notion.

Christmas Eve came and I was over at the Marsells' home. Dad and Ron were sitting in separate chairs across the room, and Bill was sitting by his Mom. She was stretched out on the couch in a makeshift bed, and the presents were passed out. She had wanted me to sit near her so that she could watch me open my gifts. I sat on the floor by her, hoping against hope that Bill did not get me the dreaded gift. That awful moment came, and Bill's mother passed down the box - it was a dress box. I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. There was Ron, Bill, his Dad and Mom, all watching me - I put off opening the box as long as I could -all other gifts had been opened, and I'm still sitting there with the wrapped dress box. Try as I could, I could not find a way to escape this moment. Bill's Mom was badgering me to open the box. I handled the box as though it contained a sensitive bomb that would explode at any moment. I gritted my teeth and proceeded to unwrap it. There, the paper was off - I shook the box for any noise, hoping there would be one, and then I could open the box knowing it was not that dreaded negligee. The box lid is off, but there's the tissue with a seal holding it shut. Bill's Mom is anxious and saying, "Bunny, don't be so slow, I want to see what Billy got you".

What will their thoughts be when I reveal the dreaded negligee? But, wait, the tissue is laying funny. I touched the paper near the corner of the box, and there didn't seem to be anything under it - yet the center still stayed as high as it was when I removed the lid. Could it be possible that it was something else?

Now, it didn't seem to be so bad to remove the tissue. There in the center of the dress box, was another gift that was taped there. It was much smaller - what could it be? I excitedly picked up that package and unwrapped it -it's a ring box! There, inside was a special engagement ring. It was so very special as Bill had given all his money to his Dad, and then got a job at St. Celestine's school (across the street from his home) as an assistant janitor and he had been working nights after his Dad got home, in order to earn money to buy me this ring. His mother was so proud! Bill's eyes were brimming with tears of pride and happiness. I will always cherish that moment. No engagement ring ever had the love and effort put into it as that one did.

It was not a very romantic way to receive an engagement ring, but both Bill and I shed many tears of joy knowing how happy it had made Bill's mother to share that moment with us. We (Bill and I) both knew that his mother would not be able to live to see us married and to see us engaged and planning our marriage, was the next best thing for her. Bill's Dad was overjoyed at seeing how happy Bill's mother was - it was a very bright silvery lining in a dark gloomy cloud that hung over their lives for almost 3 years.

Bill's whole life centered on his family, caring and providing for them. His happiness depended so completely on seeing that everyone else was happy. He had immense pride in his loved ones and doing everything possible for them. He treasured every one of his family members; but, in reality, he, was the treasure of our family!
