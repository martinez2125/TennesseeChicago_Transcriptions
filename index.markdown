# The Source

This section provides the main presentation of your source, as you have prepared it for readers (i.e., a facsimile, transcription, video, audio clip, etc.). This section is where we satisfy the first of the ADE’s three criteria for an electronic edition by providing a rigorous, accurate presentation of historical material.

For the presentation of some sources, it may make sense to break up the presentation into multiple pages. For that, as needed, we can use a more book like template (binding multiple pages together) that I can provide. Nonetheless, this page should be the page from which all presentations of the source itself start.

This may also be a space where editorial annotations are provided, such as notes on provenance, archival location, transcription, and more. If possible, a link to the source’s permanent digital location should be included here as well as a citation for that location. This should be done in consultation with the instructors, editorial board, and peer reviewers.

Please note: some presentations may benefit from a multipage format (rather than one scrolling page, as here). I can make a multipage template available to you as needed.
